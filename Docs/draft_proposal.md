# Draft Proposal for my Capstone project 

# Current license information of businesses involved in the manufacture, shipping, and/or sale of alcohol in the State of Missouri

## Data_606 Capstone : Tuesday

## BY : Sivaji Ganesh

# Introduction:
* My main goal for this project is to give people a basic idea of whether they can start a new  business in a certain place or not. This will be done by using         some machine learning algorithms to look at the sales trends and best license holders in that area by analyzing the data.

# Dataset:
* The data shows the current license information of businesses involved in the manufacture, shipping, and/or sale of alcohol in the state of Missouri. The dataset is   extracted from the link https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/missouri-active-alcohol-license-data. This data includes details such as the license type, licensee name,   address, and issuing authority for each active license.The data set is 3 mb in size. It has 18423 rows and 20 columns.


# Anlaysis:
* which model is best for predicting the sales?
* Does sales change based on the location?
* Who are the best license holders?
* chance of getting a license?


# Techniques and Models:
Several machine learning models are going to be used in this project like:
  * Classification: If the goal is to predict the likelihood of a license being granted or revoked based on various factors, classification models such as logistic       regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines could be used.
  * Regression: If the goal is to predict the number of alcohol licenses issued in a particular area or for a particular license type, regression models such as         linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks could be used.
  * Clustering: If the goal is to identify patterns or groups in the data, clustering models such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN could be used to       segment the data into clusters based on similarities in license type, location, and other factors.
  * Anomaly detection: If the goal is to identify unusual or irregular patterns in the issuance of licenses, anomaly detection models such as one-class SVM,             isolation forests, and autoencoders could be used..


# Results:
At the end of the project, I will know complete trends of alcohol sales from my data set and also will be able to predict the demand for licenses in a specific location or region based on the data. This could help government agencies and business people to start an alcohol business in a good place where they can get good profits.
