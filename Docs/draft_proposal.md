# Draft Proposal for my Capstone project 

# AH Monthly Provisional Counts of Deaths for Select Causes of Death by Sex, Age, and Race and Hispanic Origin

## Data_606 Capstone : Tuesday

## BY : Sivaji Ganesh

# Introduction:
* Human life is very important, but now a days many humans are suffering from health diseases which are caused by a person's lifestyle,Genetics,lack of physical       activity, and environmental factors. and now a days people died from many different diseases this happens when the body can't fight with the  disease. In some       cases, **early detection and treatment can help stop or slow the progression of a disease.** and also analysis on the causes of death based on this dataset will     help researchers in the medical sectors to make efforts to properly understand the social, environmental, and biological reasons that cause various conditions and   diseases.

# Goal
* Main goal of this project is to predict diseases that are major causes of death and ranking them.

# Dataset:
* This data set provides the provisional death counts due to various causes and diseases among people of Hispanic origin in the United States for different age         groups and sex. The dataset provides deaths from 2019 through 2021. The dataset is extracted from “data.gov” website and this dataset has 3960 rows and 24           columns.
* Data publisher is: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
* The following columns are in the dataset:
  * AnalysisDate – 
  * Date Of Death Year – 
  * Date of Death Month – 
  * Start Date  - 
  * End Date – 
  * Jurisdiction of Occurrence - 
  * Sex –
  * Race/Ethnicity –
  * AgeGroup – 
  * All cause –
  * Natural cause – 
  * Other Dieases: Diabetes mellitus (E10-E14), Alzheimer disease (G30), Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), Chronic lower respiratory diseases (J40-J47)
  From these features to predict the cause of death based on variables like sex, age, race, or Hispanic origin, then those columns would be the input features and     the cause of death (disease) will be the my target variable.


# Anlaysis:
* What are the most common causes of death in the population?
* How does the number of deaths for a specific cause vary by the factors like sex, race, age, and Hispanic origin?
* What are the trends in deaths over time for different causes?
* Are there any correlations between the specific causes of death and the  factors such as sex, age, Hispanic origin, and race?
* Are there any differences in the death rates between different demographic groups, and what factors may be contributing to these disparities?
* Are there any trends in the data that suggest potential risk factors for specific causes of death?


# Techniques and Models:
* Selection of the model are logistic regression, a classification model, decision trees, random forest and SVM 
* Logistic regression – This algorithm will be used for a binary classification and predict if a person is going to die from a certain disease or not.
* Decision trees – This technique is used in the identification of the factors that are effective and contribute to various deaths from a certain disease. This is     useful in predicting the probability of a death from a certain disease based on designated factors.
* Random forest -This technique would involve a combination of the prediction from the decision trees to provide a prediction that is more accurate.



# Results:
* From this project, I will know complete trends of deaths from my data and also will be able to predict future trends that cause death.This could help                 government and researchers in the medical sectors to make efforts to properly understand the social, environmental, and biological reasons that cause various         conditions and diseases.
