# Draft Proposal for my Capstone project 

# AH Monthly Provisional Counts of Deaths for Select Causes of Death by Sex, Age, and Race and Hispanic Origin

## Data_606 Capstone : Tuesday

## BY : Sivaji Ganesh

# Introduction:
* My main goal for this project is to give people a basic idea of whether they can start a new  business in a certain place or not. This will be done by using         some machine learning algorithms to look at the sales trends and also predicting best license holders in that area by analyzing the data.

# Dataset:
* This data set provides the provisional death counts due to various causes and diseases among people of Hispanic origin in the United States for different age  groups and sex. The dataset provides deaths from 2019 through 2021. The dataset is extracted from “data.gov” website. This dataset has 3960 rows and 24 columns.

# Anlaysis:
* which model is best for predicting the sales?
* Does sales change based on the location?
* Who are the best license holders?
* chance of getting a license?


# Techniques and Models:
Several machine learning models are going to be used in this project like:
  * Classification: To predict the likelihood of a license being granted or revoked based on various factors, classification models such as logistic                     regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines could be used.
  * Regression: To predict the number of alcohol licenses issued in a particular area or for a particular license type, regression models such as         linear         regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks could be used.
  * Anomaly detection: If the goal is to identify unusual or irregular patterns in the issuance of licenses, anomaly detection models such as one-class SVM,             isolation forests, and autoencoders could be used..


# Results:
At the end of the project, I will know complete trends of alcohol sales from my data set and also will be able to predict the demand for licenses in a specific location or region based on the data. This could help government agencies and business people to start an alcohol business in a good place where they can get good profits.
