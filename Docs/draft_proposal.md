# Introduction:
* My project involves using machine learning techniques to analyze active alcohol license data from a data set in order to identify trends in alcohol sales. This is   useful in business to identify sales trends.

# Dataset:
* The data shows the current license information of businesses involved in the manufacture, shipping, and/or sale of alcohol in the state of Missouri. The dataset is   extracted from the link https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/missouri-active-alcohol-license-data. This data includes details such as the license type, licensee name, address, and issuing authority for each active license.The data set is 3 mb in size. It has 18423 rows and 20 columns.


# Anlaysis:
Here are the general steps performed in the classification of "Missouri Active Alcohol License Data" using machine learning:
  * Data Preparation: This involves cleaning and preprocessing, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for machine learning.
  * Feature selection: This involves selecting the most relevant features from the data that will be used to train the model. Features could include location,           license type, and issuing authority.
  * Model selection: This involves choosing a suitable machine-learning algorithm for the task. A classification algorithm such as logistic regression, decision         trees, random forests, or support vector machines could be used in this case.
  * Model training: Involves using a portion of the data to train the machine learning model on the relationships between the features and the target variable.
  * Model evaluation: This involves using another portion of the data to evaluate the model's performance and tune the parameters to optimize its performance.
 

# Techniques and Models:
Several machine learning models can be used with the "Missouri Active Alcohol License Data" dataset, depending on the specific goals and objectives of the project. Some common models include:
  * Classification: If the goal is to predict the likelihood of a license being granted or revoked based on various factors, classification models such as logistic       regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines could be used.
  * Regression: If the goal is to predict the number of alcohol licenses issued in a particular area or for a particular license type, regression models such as         linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks could be used.
  * Clustering: If the goal is to identify patterns or groups in the data, clustering models such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN could be used to       segment the data into clusters based on similarities in license type, location, and other factors.
  * Anomaly detection: If the goal is to identify unusual or irregular patterns in the issuance of licenses, anomaly detection models such as one-class SVM,             isolation forests, and autoencoders could be used.
Finally, the model's performance is evaluated on the test data to determine its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, among other metrics. If the model's        performance is unsatisfactory, the steps may need to be repeated to improve the model.


# Results:
The use of the prediction or classification models might lead to considerable outcomes such as:
  * Predicting license approvals or renewals: The model can predict the likelihood of a license being approved or renewed based on historical data and relevant           features such as location, license type, and issuing authority.
  * Classifying license types: The model can classify licenses into different types based on the data and relevant features. This could be useful for tracking and       managing different types of licenses, such as retail, wholesale, or manufacturing licenses.
  * Forecasting license demand: The model can be used to predict the demand for licenses in a particular location or region based on historical data and relevant         features. This could help government agencies and businesses to plan and allocate resources more effectively.
  * Improving the efficiency of the license review process: The model can be used to automate certain aspects of the license review process, such as initial             screening, reducing the workload of human reviewers, and ensuring that the process is consistent and fair.
These are some of the potential outcomes of using classification or prediction models for "Missouri Active Alcohol License Data". The specific outcome will depend on the goals and objectives of the project and the data used to train the model.
