# Draft Proposal for my Capstone project 

# AH Monthly Provisional Counts of Deaths for Select Causes of Death by Sex, Age, and Race and Hispanic Origin

## Data_606 Capstone : Tuesday

## BY : Sivaji Ganesh

# Introduction:
* My main goal for this project is to give people a basic idea of whether they can start a new  business in a certain place or not. This will be done by using         some machine learning algorithms to look at the sales trends and also predicting best license holders in that area by analyzing the data.

# Dataset:
* This data set provides the provisional death counts due to various causes and diseases among people of Hispanic origin in the United States for different age         groups and sex. The dataset provides deaths from 2019 through 2021. The dataset is extracted from “data.gov” website and this dataset has 3960 rows and 24           columns.
* Data publisher is: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
* The following columns are in the dataset:
  * AnalysisDate – 
  * Date Of Death Year – 
  * Date of Death Month – 
  * Start Date  - 
  * End Date – 
  * Jurisdiction of Occurrence - 
  * Sex –
  * Race/Ethnicity –
  * AgeGroup – 
  * All cause –
  * Natural cause – 
  * Other Dieases: Diabetes mellitus (E10-E14), Alzheimer disease (G30), Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), Chronic lower respiratory diseases (J40-J47)


# Anlaysis:
* which model is best for predicting the sales?
* Which column is the label column that you want to use for prediction?


# Techniques and Models:
  * Selection of the model are logistic regression, a classification model, decision trees, random forest and SVM 
  * Logistic regression – This algorithm will be used for a binary classification and predict if a person is going to die from a certain disease or not.
  * Decision trees – This technique is used in the identification of the factors that are effective and contribute to various deaths from a certain disease. This is       useful in predicting the probability of a death from a certain disease based on designated factors.
  * Random forest -This technique would involve a combination of the prediction from the decision trees to provide a prediction that is more accurate.



# Results:
  * From this project, I will know complete trends of deaths from my data set and also will be able to predict future trends that cause death.This could help             government and researchers in the medical sectors to make efforts to properly understand the social, environmental, and biological reasons that cause various         conditions and diseases.
