# Introduction:





# Dataset:
* The data shows the current license information of businesses involved in the manufacture, shipping, and/or sale of alcohol in the state of Missouri. The dataset is   extracted from the link https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/missouri-active-alcohol-license-data. The dataset is public and covered by a variety of terms of use than   those of the data.gov. The Missouri Active Alcohol License Data on the data.gov website shows the information on active alcohol licenses in the state of Missouri.   This data includes details such as the license type, licensee name, address, and issuing authority for each active license. The information can be used to gain       insights into the distribution of alcohol licenses across the state and to monitor compliance with regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages.The data     set is 3 mb in size. It has 18423 rows and 20 columns.





# Anlaysis:


# Feature Coloumns and target variables
  My EDA feature columns will include information like the location of the target variable(s), the type of license being wanted, the state where it will be located,   and the number of cities to which it will be actively present.

  


# Techniques and Models:
Several machine learning models can be used with the "Missouri Active Alcohol License Data" dataset, depending on the specific goals and objectives of the project. Some common models include:
  * Classification: If the goal is to predict the likelihood of a license being granted or revoked based on various factors, classification models such as logistic       regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines could be used.
  * Regression: If the goal is to predict the number of alcohol licenses issued in a particular area or for a particular license type, regression models such as         linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks could be used.
  * Clustering: If the goal is to identify patterns or groups in the data, clustering models such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN could be used to       segment the data into clusters based on similarities in license type, location, and other factors.
  * Anomaly detection: If the goal is to identify unusual or irregular patterns in the issuance of licenses, anomaly detection models such as one-class SVM,             isolation forests, and autoencoders could be used.


# Results:
The use of the prediction or classification models might lead to considerable outcomes such as:
  * Predicting license approvals or renewals: The model can predict the likelihood of a license being approved or renewed based on historical data and relevant           features such as location, license type, and issuing authority.
  * Classifying license types: The model can classify licenses into different types based on the data and relevant features. This could be useful for tracking and       managing different types of licenses, such as retail, wholesale, or manufacturing licenses.
  * Forecasting license demand: The model can be used to predict the demand for licenses in a particular location or region based on historical data and relevant         features. This could help government agencies and businesses to plan and allocate resources more effectively.
  * Improving the efficiency of the license review process: The model can be used to automate certain aspects of the license review process, such as initial             screening, reducing the workload of human reviewers, and ensuring that the process is consistent and fair.
These are some of the potential outcomes of using classification or prediction models for "Missouri Active Alcohol License Data". The specific outcome will depend on the goals and objectives of the project and the data used to train the model.
