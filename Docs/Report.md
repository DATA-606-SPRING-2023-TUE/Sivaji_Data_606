# 1.Introduction:
Rainfall prediction is an important part of weather forecasting. It involves using multiple methods and strategies to forecast the amount of precipitation that will fall in a given location. 

Also, Rainfall prediction accuracy has improved significantly over the years as a result of technological improvements and the development of sophisticated models and algorithms.

This information is essential for various sectors like agriculture, water management, disaster management, and more. Like Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for agricultural activities as farmers heavily rely on weather forecasts to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, crop planting, and harvesting. Timely and precise predictions help optimize water usage, enhance crop yield, and minimize the risk of agricultural losses.

Water resource management heavily depends on rainfall predictions to efficiently allocate water supplies for irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, and urban water consumption. By monitoring rainfall patterns, authorities can manage reservoir levels, plan water supply to cities, and implement water conservation measures during drought conditions.



# 2.Abstract:
Rainfall forecast is influenced by several factors, including atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind patterns, and temperature.

In general, data must be collected from a variety of sources, including meteorological stations, satellites, and radar systems, in order to predict rainfall. then, the data is analyzed using statistical models and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends that can be used to forecast future rainfall events.

The main goal of this Project is to develop a predictive model on the Rainfall Dataset in order to forecast whether or not it will rain in  Australia tomorrow. The collection of data contains around ten years of daily weather measurements from numerous places throughout Australia.
